Determine an appropriate voxelisation automatically, using https://github.com/LArSoft/larsim/pull/135

The most important output is the list of voxels to generate photons for: other.voxels

While the actual voxel sizes will also be shown as output, this is purely for information. These settings will be used automatically in the generation stage

Simply execute source run.sh
